A software mod that makes the fridge moan when dispensing icecubes. 

IceCube Dispenser Audio Mod

IceCube Dispenser

The IceCube Dispenser Audio Mod is a simple yet fun modification for your ice cube dispenser. This mod allows you to add new audio cues (only "male" moaning at this point) It's a delightful way to add some excitement and entertainment to an otherwise mundane task.
Features

    Custom Audio Playback: Replace the default ice dispenser sound

    Easy Installation: This mod is designed to be straightforward to install, even for those with minimal technical skills.

    Compatible with Most Refrigerators: It can be adapted to work with a wide range of refrigerator models that have an ice dispenser. Note: I have not tested on any other fridges. 

    Easily Reversible: You can switch back to the default sound or remove the mod without any permanent changes to your refrigerator. Note: This is no longer the case. I am not able to revert back to factory settings. I think I bricked it. I don't think I programmed it right. Starting out it was just doing it when I was getting ice. That was cool for like 5 minutes. Now it does it randomly through the day and scares the shit out of my kids. 

Installation

    Gather Materials:
        Audio playback module located in WRF7675DHZ Whirlpool fridge.
        Light tools (Hammer, screwdriver, reciprocating saw)
        Epoxy
        Tools for connecting wires (soldering iron, wires, connectors)

    Open the Touchpad
        Gently pry open the display with a hammer or screwdriver to get at the wires and board behind it.

    Reconfigure the wiring
        I pulled on what I thought were the only wires that were connecting to the speaker. They were green. 
        
    Mount the USB drive:
        Carefully install the USB drive near the ice dispenser area where you just pulled out the green wires.  Ensure they won't obstruct the ice dispenser's operation.

    Flash the water filter to enable the USB drive:
        Flash the custom audio firmware of your module to trigger the audio playback whenever the ice dispenser is activated. The code will depend on the specific module you're using.

    Test and Adjust:
        Test the setup and make adjustments to the volume and timing as needed. You can fine-tune the mod to your liking.

    Secure Components:
        Ensure all components are securely fastened to prevent any damage to your refrigerator or injury. I used epoxy. Make sure to wear glvoes. 

    Enjoy:
        Now, whenever you dispense ice cubes, you'll be greeted with your chosen audio clips or music. (Note: This is still just a man groaning) 

Compatibility

This mod is adaptable to various refrigerator models with ice dispensers. However, the exact installation process may vary depending on your specific refrigerator's design and your chosen audio playback module. It's essential to consult your refrigerator's user manual and the documentation for your playback module for guidance.
Uninstallation

---Draft---
If you ever want to revert to the default ice dispenser sound or remove the mod, follow the reverse of the installation steps. Disconnect the playback module and speakers, and ensure that your refrigerator is restored to its original condition.
